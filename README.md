# translateIt-for-firefox
Translation plugin for the Firefox browser.

This was just a small proof-of-concept I worked on only a few days to get the hang of building a firefox plugin.

Internally, uses yandex.com for translation purposes. You will need to obtain an API-Key for this service - the provided one is just an example, will not work and should be replaced by your personal key.

Usage: Highlight a sequence of words to be translated and hit the translateIt-button (there is also a shortcut available). Translation appears in a small pop-up underneath the button.
