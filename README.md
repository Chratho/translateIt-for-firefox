# translateIt-for-firefox
Translation plugin for the Firefox browser.

This was just a small proof-of-concept I worked on only a few days to get a hang of building a firefox plugin. 

Internally, uses yandex.com for translation proposes.

Usage: Highlight a sequence of words to be translated and hit the translateIt-button (there is also a shortcut available).
Translation appears in a small pop-up underneath the button.
